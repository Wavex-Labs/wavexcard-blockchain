- Accessibility: Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Responsiveness: Fully functional on devices with screen sizes from 320px to 4K

## 4. User Interface Design

### Design Philosophy
Create a luxury NFT marketplace that emphasizes exclusivity and premium experiences while maintaining clean, intuitive user interfaces.

### Color Palette
- Primary Colors:
  - Blue theme: 
    - Primary: blue-500 (#3B82F6) for CTAs and key interactions
    - Secondary: blue-50 (#EFF6FF) for subtle backgrounds
    - Hover states: blue-600 (#2563EB) for primary, blue-100 for secondary
- Neutral Colors:
  - Text: gray-900 for headings, gray-600 for body
  - Borders: gray-200 (#E5E7EB)
  - Backgrounds: white for cards, gray-50 for subtle contrast
- Status Colors:
  - Success: green-500 (#22C55E) with green-50 background
  - Error: red-500 (#EF4444) with red-50 background

### Typography
- Page Titles: text-2xl (24px) font-bold
- Section Headers: text-xl (20px) font-bold
- Card Titles: text-lg (18px) font-semibold
- Body Text: text-base (16px)
- Supporting Text: text-sm (14px)
- Metadata: text-xs (12px)

### Spacing System
- Container padding: p-6
- Component gaps: gap-6 for large, gap-4 for medium
- Stack spacing: space-y-8 for sections, space-y-4 for content
- Grid gaps: gap-6 for card layouts

### Component Patterns
- Cards, Buttons, Input Fields, and Icons as specified in the design prompt

## 6. Data Flow

1. User actions trigger state changes or API calls
2. API responses update the global state
3. Components re-render based on state changes
4. Data is passed down to child components as props

## 7. State Management

- Use React Context API for global state management
- Implement custom hooks for complex state logic
- Utilize local component state for UI-specific state

## 8. API Integration

- Use Axios for API calls
- Implement a centralized API service for consistent error handling and request/response interceptors
- Create custom hooks for each API endpoint to encapsulate data fetching logic

## 9. Performance Optimization Strategies

- Implement code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense
- Use React.memo for expensive computations
- Optimize images using next/image
- Implement virtualization for long lists using react-window
- Use service workers for caching and offline support

## 10. Accessibility Considerations

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Maintain color contrast ratios as per WCAG guidelines
- Provide alternative text for images

## 11. Cross-Browser Compatibility

- Support latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Use Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing
- Implement feature detection and graceful degradation where necessary

## 12. Responsive Design Approach

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  - Tablet: md: (768px)
  - Desktop: lg: (1024px)
- Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- Implement responsive images using srcset and sizes attributes

## 13. Security Measures

- Implement HTTPS
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement CSRF protection
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## 14. Testing Methodologies

- Unit Testing: Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration Testing: Cypress
- End-to-End Testing: Playwright
- Visual Regression Testing: Percy
- Performance Testing: Lighthouse CI

## 15. Deployment Processes

- Use GitLab CI/CD for automated deployments
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts
- Use Docker for consistent environments
- Deploy to a CDN for global content delivery
- Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates

## Conclusion

This technical specification provides a comprehensive guide for developing the WaveX NFT Platform frontend. It ensures a consistent, high-quality, and performant user experience while maintaining the luxury and exclusivity of the platform. Regular reviews and updates to this document will be necessary as the project evolves.
