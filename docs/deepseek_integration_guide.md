1. Clone the DeepSeek repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek.git
   cd DeepSeek
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Follow the specific installation instructions in the DeepSeek README for any additional setup steps.

## 3. Understanding Our Blockchain Project

Our project is a blockchain-based NFT platform with advanced features. Here's an overview of key components:

### Smart Contracts
The main smart contract is `WaveXNFTV2`, located in `contracts/v2/WaveXNFTV2.sol`. Key features include:

- ERC721 token implementation with additional functionality
- Template-based NFT minting
- Balance management for tokens
- Event creation and ticket purchasing
- Merchant authorization system
- Support for multiple payment tokens

### Project Structure
- Smart Contracts: Located in `contracts/v2/WaveXNFTV2.sol`
- Interfaces: `contracts/interfaces/IWaveXNFTV2.sol`
- Libraries: `contracts/libraries/WaveXLib.sol`
- Deployment Scripts: Found in `scripts/deploy/`
- Configuration: Check `config/contract.config.js` and `hardhat.config.js`
- Testing: Tests are in `test/v2/WaveXNFTV2.test.js`

### Key Functions
1. Template Management: `initializeDefaultTemplates`, `addTemplate`, `modifyTemplate`
2. Token Minting: `mintFromTemplate`
3. Balance Management: `topUpBalance`, `processPayment`
4. Event Management: `createEvent`, `purchaseEventEntrance`
5. Merchant Management: `authorizeMerchant`, `revokeMerchant`, `addSupportedToken`

Familiarize yourself with these components to understand the project structure and functionality.

## 4. Training DeepSeek on Blockchain Concepts

To train DeepSeek on blockchain concepts specific to our project:

1. Prepare a dataset of blockchain-related text, including:
   - Solidity code snippets from our WaveXNFTV2 contract
   - Explanations of our contract's functionality (template system, balance management, event ticketing)
   - Documentation on NFTs and token standards (ERC721, ERC20)
   - OpenZeppelin library usage in our contract
   - Hardhat configuration and deployment scripts

2. Create project-specific prompts and responses, such as:
   - "Explain the template system in WaveXNFTV2 and how it's used for minting NFTs"
   - "Describe the balance management system in WaveXNFTV2 and how it differs from standard ERC721 tokens"
   - "How does the event ticketing system work in WaveXNFTV2?"

3. Use DeepSeek's fine-tuning scripts to train on this dataset. Example command (adjust based on DeepSeek's specific requirements):
   ```
   python train.py --data_path ./wavex_blockchain_dataset --model_name deepseek-wavex-blockchain
   ```

4. Validate the model's understanding by testing it with project-specific queries and tasks.
